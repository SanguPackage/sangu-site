One of those levels you **really** want to look at the flyby as the level is loading...
<br>
Any combination is possible but you typically want the following path:
<ul>
    <li>Blizzard Fans with Slingus Flingus</li>
    <li>Lily Pads & Hammers <b>OR</b> Inflating Frogs (there seems to be no consensus here)</li>
    <li>Rotating Donuts with Spinning Beam</li>
</ul>
